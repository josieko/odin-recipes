    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 of the chopped anchovy filets and cook for 1 minute, until they begin to melt.</li>
        <li>Add the panko bread crumbs and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Transfer the bread crumbs to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature. Once cooled, toss with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Heat Â¼ cup (60 ml) of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the remaining 6 anchovies and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the anchovies begin to melt into the oil.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and stir to coat in the oil. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and cook for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes just begin to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta and reserved cooking water to the pot with the tomatoes and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute, until the pasta is well coated and saucy. Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta topped with the anchovy bread crumbs and lemon zest and enjoy!</li>
